## Heart Prediction

The dataset was consists of four database:  Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. Our objective was to predict that the given person is having heart disease or not with the help of several factor which are causing eg- age,cholesterol level,type of chest pain etc.

Performing several algorithem like: Binary Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest.After perfoning the machine learning algorithm we can observe that we get accuracy ranging from 76% to 84%.Out of which best accuracy of found by performing Random Forest i.e. 83.5%.
