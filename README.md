## Titanic Dataset

The Dataset consist of 891 Observations from which 342 survived and 549 non-survived. Our objective was to predict that the given person is survived or not with help of building ML model.

Perfoming several ML algorithm like BLR, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes. After perfoming the ML algorithm, we can observe that we get accuracy ranging from 78% to 83%. Best accuracy was given by Naive Bayes which is 82.33%.
