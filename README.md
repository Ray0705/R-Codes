## Heart Prediction

The dataset was consists of four database:  Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. Our objective was to predict that the given person is having heart disease or not with the help of several factor which are causing eg- age,cholesterol level,type of chest pain etc.

Performing several algorithm like: Binary Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest.After perfoming the machine learning algorithm we can observe that we get accuracy ranging from 76% to 84%.Out of which best accuracy of found by performing Random Forest i.e. 83.5%.

## Titanic Dataset

The Dataset consist of 891 Observations from which 342 survived and 549 non-survived. Our objective was to predict that the given person is survived or not with help of building ML model.

Perfoming several ML algorithm like BLR, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes. After perfoming the ML algorithm, we can observe that we get accuracy ranging from 78% to 83%. Best accuracy was given by Naive Bayes which is 82.33%.
